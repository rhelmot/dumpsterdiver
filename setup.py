This is a library for interactively exploring the heap of a python program to track down leaks.
The basic intuition is that you _know_ that your program shouldn't be taking 2 gigabytes of memory at this point, and it's probably a bunch of objects of a single type taking up all that memory.
But how do you figure out who's holding the references to them?

Python's built in `gc` module gives you the tools to figure it out, but it's a tedious process and if you do it in an interactive session you're going to be generating a bunch of additional references that will complicate your search pretty drastically.
This tool was built after several hours of frustration with this!

Then, to detox, I learned `prompt_toolkit` and made the prompt pretty.
